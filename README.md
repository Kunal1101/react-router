# React Router

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a React + Vite project that demonstrates the use of **React Router** for navigation. It shows how we can create a layout and can just change the main component with using **Outlet**. We don't need to call header and footer on each page component. We also learn the use of **useParams()** to allows you to access URL parameters inside a React component.
